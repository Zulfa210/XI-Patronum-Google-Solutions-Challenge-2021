### Challenge we are solving:
Today, there are a lot of people willing to donate their time and resources to charity. Their major problem is where and how do they start. We provide our users a platform where they can find and connect with a number of charitable organizations at the same time. This simplifies the process by providing the user all the resources in one place. The user can contact various organizations via our platform and give to different charities without the hussle of keeping track of them on different platforms. Our aim is to simplify the process while encourage more people to donate to charity.<br/><br/>

## Working
---
Our webiste is divided into 3 different parts as follows:
1. Events Page - This is the main page of our website and consists of all the events that have been posted by the registered organizations. A user can register for the events by clicking the "Register" button.<br/>
Click on the events tab on the navbar and you will be redirected to this page.<br/>

2. Partner with us - The Partner with us page allows organization to register on our platform and connect with a wider userbase. The page also shows all the UN goals that our system aims to satisfy. The registration form includes various details like NGO name, contact information, etc. The form also needs to be provided with the NGO ID assigned to the organization by the government. This will be used to verify the credibilty of the organizations and provide the user with authentic alliances only. They can also check all the UN goals that they work towards which will help the users get a better idea about their work.<br/>
On the navbar, by clicking on NGO displays a mega menu consisting of all the organizations partnered with us. This list is sorted according to the location.

## Future Scope
---
As of now our solution is adequate for a smaller audience size. Our next step for the project would be to modify it to accomodate a larger audience by adding various functionalities as required. We would also like to automate our verification of the users and organizations to make the project more reliable and fast. We would also like to enhance user experience based on the feedback that we receive from them.
